**Project Description: Online Payment App Analysis**  

This project analyzes transaction data from an online payment app to identify usage patterns, transaction trends, and customer retention. It aims to provide insights into customer behavior and optimize app performance for better user satisfaction and strategic decision-making. 

# Insights:  

**1. Transaction Growth and Seasonal Trends:** Transactions in 2018 surged significantly compared to 2017, peaking towards the end of each year during festive seasons like Christmas and Tet Holiday.  

**2. Peak Hours:** High transaction volumes occur typically from 7 AM to 9 PM, aligning with people's daily activities and work hours.  

**3. Transaction Failures:** The correlation between increasing transaction volumes and rising failure rates underscores the challenges faced, despite overall improvements in error management. However, the failure rates in 2018 reduced significantly compared to 2017, indicating major system updates.  

**4. Common Errors:** The most common errors were 'payment failed', 'incorrect password', and 'insufficient funds', which increased notably towards the end of 2018. Addressing these issues is crucial for improving customer experience.  

**5. Preferred Payment Method:** Users favored 'Money in app' the most, with over 160,000 successful transactions, showing a strong upward trend by late 2018.  

**6. Product Analysis:** Payment and top-up account were the most used product categories over both years, with top-up accounts showing the highest transaction amounts. Money in app was preferred except in the top-up account category, where banking accounts were favored.  

**7. Promotion Analysis:** Promotion-related orders constituted only 5% of total orders, with a declining trend in 2017 and a slight increase in 2018. Only payment products received promotions, with telco transactions having the highest promotion volume, nearly 9k orders.  

**8. Retention Rates:** Retention rates in 2017 were stable, while 2018 saw a mid-year decline followed by a slight recovery towards year-end. The decline was not attributable to promotion programs, suggesting other factors at play that require further investigation.
